# React + Vite

### In this project, I had learned about <ins>useState</ins>, <ins>useEffect</ins>, <ins>useCallback</ins> and <ins>useRef</ins>.

1. **<ins>useState</ins>** is a React Hook that lets you add a state variable to your component.
   * const [state, setState] = useState(initialState).

2. **<ins>useEffect</ins>** is a React Hook that lets you <ins>synchronize a component with an external system</ins>.
   * ***Synchronizing with Effects***: Some components need to synchronize with external systems. For example, you might want to control a non-React component based on the React state, set up a server connection, or send an analytics log when a component appears on the screen. Effects let you run some code after rendering so that you can synchronize your component with some system outside of React.<br>
   * useEffect(setup, dependencies?).

3. **<ins>useCallback</ins>** is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders.
   * const cachedFn = useCallback(fn, dependencies).

4. **<ins>useRef</ins>** is a React Hook that lets you reference a value thatâ€™s not needed for rendering.
   * const ref = useRef(initialValue).
